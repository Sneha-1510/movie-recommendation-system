## How the Project Works

### Dataset & Preprocessing
1. **Dataset**:
   - Collected from reliable sources containing metadata like movie title, genre, and release date.
   - Includes user interaction data to simulate recommendations.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaned and formatted dataset.
   - Converted dates into a standard format (`%B %d, %Y`).
   - Processed genres into a relational structure for better querying.

---

### Database Schema
The SQLite database contains the following tables:
- **Users**: Stores user credentials (username, password hash).
- **Movies**: Holds movie metadata (title, genre, date added, etc.).
- **UserInteractions**: Tracks likes, watches, and other user activities.
